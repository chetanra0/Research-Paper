# Research-Paper
Cloud computing in recent years has developed into an essential component of 
modern digital infrastructures, emerging from the concept of shared resources. This 
document explores the growth of cloud computing from its roots in grid computing, 
virtualization technology, and modern service based models such as IaaS, PaaS, 
and SaaS. 
It emphasizes the transformation of cloud computing from an internal IT 
infrastructure solution to a globally accessible public utility, largely propelled by major 
technology behemoths like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. To understand how 
organizations utilize clouds for agility and rapid horizontal scalability, contemporary 
practices like serverless architectures, multiclass cloud adoptions, and edge-cloud 
integration are studied. Lastly, the document analyzes new frontiers such as 
AI-enabled cloud services, initiatives focused on green computing, and development 
of security and compliance regulations.Studying these changes helps in 
understanding the dynamics of how cloud computing is changing technology, 
business, and society. 
Lastly, the paper analyzes the implications of AI on cloud services, green computing 
projects, evolving security and compliance mandates, and other emerging clouds 
initiatives to discuss future trends. Studying the history helps illustrate the impact 
cloud computing has on technology, business, and society in real time.
